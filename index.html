						<h2>Sample Achievements</h2>
					</header>
					<ul>
						<li>Bagged the prestigious Shell's ShareIT award for innovation (of a proactive service availability monitoring and analytics tool in July 2011), for the first time in sub-sahara Africa. 
						Solution reduced unplanned downtime by 60%.
						</li>
						<li>
							Leveraging extensive data engineering/mining and SQL skills, rescued Shell Pension company, a $4million investment company from penalties/fines (and threat to reputation) by reproducing from scratch 5-year mandatory reports upon request by the regulatory body (PENCOM) years after the source HR system (HRMS) had been decommissioned and IT resources scrapped.
						</li>
						<li>Assured business continuity over 30+ applications through successful coordination (Project Management) of Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) ensuring plans were kept to-date and changes follow standard change management procedures to guarantee integrity of configuration items.
						</li>
						<li>Demonstrating expertise in utilizing advanced analytical techniques to tackle complex challenges and deliver actionable insights, led 3 different data science/ML studies that provided strata of SCiN leadership with valuable insights and facilitated informed decision making:
						   <p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">o	2021. Interplay of water and crude injection ratios by the IOC and third parties, and the impact on TF (Terminal Factor) for the Wells, Reservoir and Facility Management department. The result triggered inquiries into some stakeholders’ injection claims.</p>
						   <p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">o	2022. Detection of leakage/theft points and scale along the Trans Niger Pipeline with a view to arresting the falling TF using a combination of Machine Learning and Econometrics methods e.g. ITSA (Interrupt Time Series Analysis) </p>
						   <p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">o	2023. Cut down financial losses associated with uncertainty around weather (meteorological/oceanic elements forecast and its impact on Tri-catenary Mooring system (TCMS) of lifting crude oil at the terminal by at least 80%.  The solution is a combination of four optimally tuned regression models. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Built and deployed an NLP based text classification model for mapping facility downtime (incident) reports written by field engineers to predefined incident summaries in the corporate Hydrocarbon Accounting Management System, namely Energy Component. Exposed the functionality of the model through React.js front-end and Node.js backend for optimal user experience. This reduced the time spent by Reliability engineers in vetting/validating the reports by over 50% and thus improved overall efficiency which resulted in cut-down on production deferment by 15%.
						</li>
						<li>
							Developed Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions which functionalities range from facilitation of IT audit controls assessment and reporting, download of filled COVID-19 test user consent forms from JotForm site, and submission of finalized monthly returns to national pension regulatory body using Power Automate Desktop (PAD), Blue Prism and UiPath.
						</li>
						<li>
							Salvaged $50K investment in a proprietary Real estate Service Charge Allocation & Reconciliation management system (Archibus) abandoned by users on account of cumbersome data loading procedure. Designed, developed, and deployed a user-friendly (.Net) web-based alternative that shortened the time taken by the annual reconciliation exercise from 3 months to 1 week. Thanks to my skills in C# .net, SQL, Oracle DB, AngularJs, JQuery and Bootstrap. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Collaborated with other data enthusiasts to redesign/re-structure the database of a $75K investment in a 3rd party Health Management system which we found out had lapses in enforcement of referential integrity on data parts. This project eliminated the safety risks posed (given the sensitivity of health records) by the errors of cross-prescription amongst others, and restored confidence in the use of the system.
						</li>
						<li>
							As Technical Lead, provided technical direction during process improvement exercises e.g., LEAN (Kaizen events) session and manage the implementation of system related recommendations from such sessions. Has been instrumental to extra-ordinary achievements (rewarded with Special Recognition Award) by customer departments e.g., LEAN implementations to Shell Health Information System for Medical department resulted in COHSHASA certification and services of Security department was retained following successful audit after LEAN implementation.
						</li>
						<li>
							In the year 2010, single-handedly resolved long-time technical challenges that had hindered deployment of .NET based solutions in Shell Gabon, leveraging verse knowledge of Windows and .NET framework. Deployed the first (ever).net based application  and assisted others to progress deployments hitherto suspended.
